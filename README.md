# Oystor - Oyster Storage and Visualization Tool
 This application is for the record keeping of oyster stock in accordance with FDA and the State of Maine Department of Marine Resources' requirements. It is a first attempt to create a useable resource for oyster farmers to track and log their wet storage bins. I have set up this iteration based on my current company's storage setup but there are plans in the works to allow for different farms to create their own storage setups. This will be long term project as it has been something I've thought about for years. Let me know if you can think of any improvements. Thanks11
